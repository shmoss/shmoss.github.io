				<p>This research examined the relationship between voting and crime in Chicago.  It stems from my long-standing interest in demographics, urban crime, and voter behavior.  I developed a fascincation with Chicago when I visited countless Chicago Public Schools as one of Mayor Daley's Safe Routes ambassadors in 2009.  I usually travelled by bicycle, experiencing nearly every Chicago neighborhood up close.  I later analyzed Chicago voting patterns in my work with the <i>Mexican American Legal and Education Defense Fund</i> (MALDEF) and became aware of the vast disparities in voter turnout over different parts of Chicago.  My Master's thesis is an amalgam of these diverse interests, and brings my interest in Chicago full-circle.

				Research shows that voting is a socially-conforming behavior - in other words - people often vote because they perceive voting to be a social norm.  Voting has also been linked to broader norm-govered behavior, such as participation in the U.S. census and other forms of civic engagement.  
				</p>

				<p>
				Knowing that voting can lead to more socially cooperative behavior, research has tried to address whether voting and crime are linked.  Stephen Coleman (2004), in a county-level analysis, showed that crime rate is highest where voter turnout is near 50% - the point at which there is no conformity to the voting norm.  The assumption is that if conformity to the voting norm is absent, broader norm-govered behavior like obeying the law will also be lacking.
				</p>
				<p>
				My research examines the relationship between voter turnout and crime rate at the Chicago neighborhood level.  I use a statistical approach but also look at the spatial patterns of the relationship between voting and crime over space using the spatial regression technique Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).
